# An Autonomous Driving Alarm Clock

My first forage into firmware development! :)

This moving alarm clock is intended for the stubborn sleeper who just can't get out of bed within the first 3 (or 15) alarms. The lovable rover intends to address this by adding a physical disturbance in the form of driving around the user's bedroom and house on top of the standard alarm bells to create an appropriate disruption which forces people awake. 

The act of chasing the alarm clock throughout the house will in most situations bring the user (and others) out of their bed and relieve them of any more dopey mornings.


More to come....
