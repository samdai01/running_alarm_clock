# Movement

## Overview

This directory contains Arduino libraries for all of the movement code for the running alarm clock. Code that controls the servo motors should go directly here.

## Setup

Move the folder `alarm_clock_movement` into the the `C:\Program Files\\(x86)\\Arduino\\Libraries` or the install location libraries directory to add the source code as an Arduino library. 

## TODO:
Movement is not stright, adjust the speed values and record the 
proper percentages (approximate) to make the alarm clock go 
perfectly straight.

## Libraries Included

`alarm_clock_motor_movement`
* standard functions to move the alarm clock forward, backward, left, and right
